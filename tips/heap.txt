Max heap parent greater than child
Min heap parent less than child root is minimum

Heap is always a complete tree

Focus on max binary heap 

Search worst case O(n) avg case O(n/2) still is linear

heapify - Put element to leaf insert and swap upwards
Insert and delete O(log n) equivalent to height of tree
Advantage of storing in array is space efficiency
Trees uses vals and link data struct 
array uses indexes so its easy but array must be ordered calculate to 2 powers
