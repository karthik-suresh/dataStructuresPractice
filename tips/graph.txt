DFS
Efficiency O(E+V)
Implemented as a stack push visited pop revisit

BFS
Efficiency O(E+V)
Implemented as tree

Dijkstras shortestpath greeedy
Priority queue is implemented
add sum weights everytime and compare
efficiency O(V square) can be made to O(E + E log V)

Knapsack weight value combination O(nW)
Dynamic programming very important try if we can break every problem into sub problems and store it into memoisation 
so it is not needed to be computed again
